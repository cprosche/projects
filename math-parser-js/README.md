# JS Math String Parser

- [x] Subtraction/Addition Support
- [ ] Multiplication/Addition Support
- [ ] Parentheses Support
- [ ] Exponent Support
- [ ] Trig Function Support

This parser takes in math equations as a string and returns the calculated value

This would be very useful for building calculators as you can input values as plain text

This is also built to not rely on .eval() as it is insecure and not rely on an outisde library like math.js
